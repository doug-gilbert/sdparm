Build
===== 

    ./configure
    make
    make install (you may need to be root to do this)


If configure.ac, Makefile.am or src/Makefile.am are changed
then ./autogen.sh should be run prior to the above sequence.

An rpm spec file called sdparm.spec is included in the main
directory. This spec file expects to find a tarball
called "sdparm-<version_num>.tgz" in the appropriate place.
The author uses the alien utility to convert the sdparm binary
rpm into the equivalent debian package.

To build a debian "deb" (binary) package, first untar the tarball, then
change directory to the top level within the sdparm source. Then:
 # chmod +x debian/rules
 # dpkg-buildpackage -b -rfakeroot
The binary deb packages will be placed in the parent directory (of
the sdparm source directory) if all goes well.
