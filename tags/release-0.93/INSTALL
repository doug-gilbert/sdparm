Build
===== 

    ./configure
    make
    make install (you may need to be root to do this)


If configure.in, Makefile.am or src/Makefile.am are changed
then ./autogen.sh should be run prior to the above sequence.

An rpm spec file called sdparm.spec is included in the main
directory. This spec file expects to find a tarball
called "sdparm-<version_num>.tgz" in the appropriate place.
The author uses the alien utility to convert the sdparm binary
rpm into the equivalent debian package.
