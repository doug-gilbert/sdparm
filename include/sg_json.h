/* Convert a byte stream that is meant to be printable ASCII or UTF-8 to
 * something that is allowable in a JSON string. This means treating the
 * ASCII control characters (i.e. < 0x20) and DEL as specials. Also '\' and
 * '"' need to be escaped with a preceding '\'. These C escape codes are used
 * in JSON: '\b', '\f', '\n', '\r' and '\t'. Other control characters, and DEL
 * are encoded as '\x<hh>' where <hh> is two hex digits. So the DEL and
 * null ACSII characters in the input will appear as '\x7f' and '\x00'
 * respectively in the output. The output serializer will expand those
 * two to '\\x7f' and '\\x00'. Note that the JSON form of '\u<hhhh>' is
 * _not_ used. The input is pointed to by 'cup' which is 'ulen' bytes long.
 * The output is written to 'op' and will not exceed 'olen_max' bytes. If
 * 'olen_max' is breached, this function returns -1 else it returns the
 * number of bytes written to 'op'. */
