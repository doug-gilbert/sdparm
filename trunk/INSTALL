Building from source
====================
Once the source tarball has been untarred move to its top
level directory and issue these commands: 

    ./configure
    make
    make install (you may need to be root to do this)


If configure.ac, Makefile.am or src/Makefile.am have changed
then ./autogen.sh should be run prior to the above sequence.

A linux rpm spec file called sdparm.spec is included in the main
directory. This spec file expects to find a tarball
called "sdparm-<version_num>.tgz" in the appropriate place.

To build a linux debian "deb" (binary) package, first untar the tarball,
then change directory to the top level within the sdparm source. Then:
 # chmod +x debian/rules
 # dpkg-buildpackage -b -rfakeroot
The binary deb packages will be placed in the parent directory (of
the sdparm source directory) if all goes well.

In FreeBSD, the configure/make/make_install method should work.

With Tru64 this invocation can be used:
    "./autogen.sh && CC=cc ./configure && gmake"
